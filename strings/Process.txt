For This challenge, the process involved first getting each line of code to only contain the width of desired characters.
To implement this, the input text was broken into paragraphs and each paragraph was broken into words.  Once we had the
different paragraphs and words, all that was left to do was create the lines with a max width of 40.  The lines were
created for each paragraph and stored.  After this was done, the program Iterated through each line writing each line
in the desired .txt file.

For the second part of this challenge, I first thought about using python fuction for leftalign and rightalign.  Then
I decided I could just find the difference between the desired width and the width each line occupied.  If this difference
was greater than one, I loopped through the words until the last one and added a space until the length of the line
was equal to the desired width.
