# Desafio 1: Strings

Both the first part of the challenge and the second part are in the main script.  The second part uses the first
part.  To use the script, in the main.py script, just specify the directory for a text file, and the directory for the
output file in the script.  Once this is changed it will save the justified text in the directory specified by the name
specified.

Currently the script is using /TextFile/text.txt as the input text.  This is the text given in the challenge.  It saves
the output in the TextFile directory with the name output.txt.
