For this challenge, part 1, I started using beautiful soup.  However, I realized there was a easier way to do it
using request and praw.  I built both versions because praw requires the user to have an account with reddit.  Using
request you don't need to have an account.  Once I found that the data was just stored as a json I just found the key
for the different data we were looking for and saved those to a variable.  Then I created a dictionary inside a dictionary
to store all the data for each thread.

For the bot, I was not sure where to start at first.  However, looking at the telegram api I found easy example to follow
 to create the bot.  My reasoning was that I could handle the bot just like a command line interface, as long as I could
 get the string of the command it was sending through, I could figure out what it wanted to do.  Once I got a easy example
 working that was able to read characters, I created a if loop that would respond if the characters were equal to
 /NadaPraFazer.  I then decided to use the string.split() function to split between the first command and the second.  This
 allowed me to use the second command as the subreddits it wanted to find.  I added a third command so it was easier to
 specify how many threads the user wanted to see, this make it so the user didn't get a lot of threads messaged to them
 if they only wanted one or two.
